# TODO
## Should FIX
- `Badly compressed packet - size of 2 is below server threshold of 256` with `offline-mod=false`. Disable compression if you have `online-mode=false`.

## Rules
- CreativeKill default behaviour with item frames.
- CreativeKill should kill falling sands.
- No max velocity.
- Dispensers place items in item frames.
- Bed fallback.
- Disable baby with spawn egg.
- 5 mins despawn xp orb.
